\section{Introduction}
\label{Introducion}
Information systems are concerned with data capture, storage, analysis, and retrieval. These are vital to assist decision-making in a short time frame, potentially allowing decisions to be made and practices to be action-ed in real time.  In the context of diet and nutrition management, nutritional health systems allow for accurate and efficient analysis of food ingredients as well as patient nutrient intake which assists in ensuring that selected food combinations offer the desired nutrients for a particular meal or diet order (\cite{DFM}). 


\subsection{Background}
\label{Background}
Dietary deficiency is more accountable for the overall death toll on the global scale than other factors such as tobacco, high blood pressure, or any other health risk, as indicated in the new scientific study. “Poor diet is an equal opportunity killer,” (\cite{ihme2019new}). Low levels of healthy food consumption, such as whole grains, in contrast to too many unhealthy foods, including sweetened beverages, account for one in every five deaths globally, “We are what we eat and risks affect people across a range of demographics, including age, gender, and economic status,” (\cite{ihme2019new}).

Poor diets were behind the 10.9 million deaths, or 22\% of all deaths among adults in 2017, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the foremost cause, trailed by cancers and diabetes. They also resulted in 255 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), equaling the sum of years lost and years lived with disability. Poor diet statistically represents 16\% of all DALYs among adults globally. The findings of the study dictate that while the impact of individual dietary factors varies across countries, three dietary factors – low intake of whole grains, as well as fruits, and high consumption of sodium – accounted for more than 50\% of diet-related deaths and 66\% of DALYs. The other 50\% of death and 34\% of DALYs were tied to high consumption of red meat, processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, and trans fatty acids among other foods. There is an urgent and compelling need for changes in the various sectors of the food production cycle, such as growing, processing, packaging, and marketing (\cite{ihme2019new}).

Uganda has shown limited progress toward achieving the diet-related non-communicable disease (NCD) targets. Furthermore, it has shown no progress towards achieving the target for obesity, with an estimated 10.4\% of adult (aged 18 years and over) women and 2.3\% of adult men living with obesity. Uganda's obesity prevalence is lower than the regional average of 20.7\% for women and 9.2\% for men. At the same time, diabetes is estimated to affect 5.6\% of adult women and 5.6\% of adult men (\cite{globalnutritionreportn.d.}). The motivation for feeding should not only be to stop hunger, but also to increase the general awareness of the nutritional value of the food ingested.

\subsection{Problem statement}
Improper diet and nutrition are caused by inconsistent intake of healthy foods. Other causes include improper meal timings, under or overeating, not having enough healthy foods, and nutritional ignorance. Experts have revealed that only 10\% of children below the age of five years are eating recommended healthy foods and this includes frequenting eating nutritious meals and eating on time. This has left the majority 90\% eating non-nutritious foods which has resulted in increasing numbers of childhood malnutrition and obesity (\cite{tumwine2022only}). “People are eating a lot of unhealthy foods that do not contribute to the manufacturing of blood in the body which has made them sicker.”(\cite{tumwine2022only}). We therefore intend to contain this problem by developing a diet and nutrition management system which will guide the targeted populace categories majorly students to maintain a healthy selection of well-balanced meals daily.

\subsection{Objectives}
\subsubsection{General Objectives}

To develop a diet and nutrition management system that will provide students with timely suggestions on the food they should consume to remain healthy. 

\subsubsection{Specific Objectives}

To identify the requirements for a Diet and Nutrition Management System in order to understand what the would-be users of the system would want.

To design a model and implement the system that will be used to assist in maintaining healthy diet meal patterns.

To test and validate the system.  

\subsection{Justification.}
Improper diet and nutrition is a constant challenge to many students which adversely exposes them to risks like obesity, digestive problems, and chronic illnesses. From the listed effects, our system intends to; 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Increase awareness on the dire consequences of improper diet and nutrition
  \item provide a practical means to improve feeding patterns daily. 
  \item customize a system to the needs of Students Population. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}
Our research will be focused on locally grown foods in Uganda that consist of a balanced diet and specific chronic illnesses like Diabetes, obesity, pressure and cancer. We will major at Makerere University. We intend to sample several students from colleges such as CEDAT, COCIS, and CHUSS to know the foods they regularly eat.

\subsection{Significance}
The system we aim to build will help the elderly remind them when to best consume their meals. Athletes, through consuming the right foods will receive the required food values thus boosting their sports performance. Pregnant mothers will be able to sustain a healthy pregnancy through appropriate meals for both the unborn baby and the expectant mother. Students will be able to register an improvement in their overall mental health, especially regarding memory retention and the intelligence quotient.  People with chronic illnesses will realize the nutritional value of eating suitable foods and as a result, reduced disability-adjusted Life years. As far as academia is concerned, it will assist to refine the focus of the research on the diet and nutrition context and predict any challenges that may arise out of it.

\newpage
\section{Literature Review}

According to Wikipedia (\citeyear{wikipedia2019dietary}), dietary management simply means providing nutritional options for individuals and groups with diet concerns through the supervision of food services. Information systems have made it easier for accurate and efficient nutritional analysis of feeding habits and patterns.

This section focuses on the exploration of different solutions developed by researchers to alleviate the problem of poor eating habits among university students. We reviewed similar systems regarding the problems faced by students when they skip meals or even fail to eat at the right time. The solution we aim to provide for this problem is to develop a diet and nutrition management system that will provide students with timely reminders, food suggestions, and nutrition literature.

We realized that so much research has been done by researchers from the field of nutrition science where a person is trained to provide information regarding the types and quantities of food the people eat. This field draws information from other areas such as biology, chemistry, and social sciences (\cite{sriram2020hire}).

The review is comprised of works that have been done to find the solution to the problem and we were able to sample various systems. We singled out systems that were closely related to our research problem and we noted the strengths and weaknesses of the solutions. By studying these systems, we were able to find the deficiency in the solutions regarding our problem and stated ways in which the solutions can be tailored to satisfy our target group. The features of the reviewed systems are compared with those of the proposed system in Table 1.

\subsection{Proposed Project}
As a group, we shall develop a web application that will require university students to register possibly with their name and email addresses that will be used to send notifications to eat food cost-effectively. After this, they will be able to receive timely reminders on the minimum amount and type of food they should consume to successfully fulfill their daily tasks. This will include a mix of foods such as Matooke, Rice, and Sweet potatoes and drinks such as water and a cup of tea. It will also include general knowledge on how they can maintain a healthy and functioning body such as drinking lots of water, exercising regularly, and avoiding harmful consumption of alcohol, and drugs among others.
This will provide a more customized and cost-effective feeding way for university students to allow them to focus on their studies as they also take care of their health.

\newpage
\section{Research Methodology}
\subsection{Introduction }
In this section, we shall share all the methods and tools that we shall use to carry out our research and fulfill all the stated specific objectives that the system to be developed should have.  It presents the description of the research design, study area, sample and sampling techniques. 

\subsection{System Development Life Cycle}
The SDLC design that we shall deploy to develop the system is the waterfall model. The waterfall model is a classical model used in the system development life cycle to create a system with a linear and sequential approach. This is so because our requirements for the system are clearly defined and well-known.

%Image of the Waterfall SDLC

\begin{center}
\vspace{30px}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{Proposal_waterfall-SDLC.png}
\label{SDLC_waterfall_diagram}
\vspace{30px}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Project Planning}
Project planning is at the heart of the project life cycle, and tells everyone involved where you are going and how you are going to get there. This is where we shall document the project plan, define the project requirements and deliverables, and create the project schedule. It will involve creating a set of plans to help guide our team through the implementation and closure phases of the project. The plans created during this phase will help us manage time, cost, quality, changes, risk, and related issues. They will also help us control staff and external suppliers to ensure that we deliver the project on time, within budget, and within schedule.

\subsubsection{Requirements Definition}
In this phase, all requirements of the project are defined and documented in a specification document and a feasibility analysis is done to check if these requirements are valid. At this stage, as developers, we shall gather data from the desired sample of the population about the different aspects of their diet and nutrition. The collection of this data will involve different steps that include; Identify issues and opportunities for collecting data, setting goals and objectives, planning approaches and methods, and Collecting data. The collected data will enable one to answer stated research questions, test hypotheses, and evaluate outcomes.

In our research process, we shall use a hybrid method which is comprised of both qualitative and quantitative methods to carry out the data collection process. We shall use Makerere University as our case study specifically the students due to the ease we shall find in collecting the research information and because we are part of the community and are able to fathom the depth of the problem.   

Among the tools we shall use will include a questionnaire which will be sent to students from colleges which will be grouped into two and the first group will be comprised of undergraduate students from colleges such as CEDAT and CHS. This will be aimed at gathering information from students who have spent over 5 years at the university so that we can get a chain of events and know how their feeding has changed all over the years and benefits or sets backs they have faced with meals while at the university. The second group will include students from COCIS,  and COBAMS where the courses are on average 3 years and also check on the effects their feeding has had on their health and studies. 

We shall use the interviews and observation techniques to understand the patterns that students use to select their daily meals at the different break intervals during the course of the day.

\subsubsection{Requirements Analysis}
Also, at this stage will be analyzed how this system will meet user needs when using this website to place an order. The requirements gathered will be both functional and non-functional requirements. For example, Functional include “The system should authenticate a user’s new account in order to gain access.” Non-functional “The system should be able to handle 50 users without performance deterioration.” and others. After thorough analysis, a Requirements Understanding Document (RUD) is created.

The main purpose of conducting system analysis is to study the various processes and to find out its requirements. This includes ways of processing data, producing information, controlling a business activity or supporting management. The determination of requirements entrails studying the existing details about it to find out what these requirements are. The data will be analyzed with Microsoft Excel so that we can get matching patterns and also filter out what is necessary for us to be able to determine the users needs.

We will come up with a Software requirements specification document that helps formalize the functional and non-functional requirements

\subsubsection{System Design}
At the design stage, the system design will be made, such as the method to be used, use case diagrams, activity diagrams, wire-frames and mockup designs. Design and Development of the diet management system using Waterfall Model. At this stage, we will describe the needs and behaviors that the system can perform in the form of UML. UML diagrams that are made are diagrams like, Use Case, Class Diagram, and Activity Diagram and display on the website or called the user interface.

\paragraph{Use Case Diagram Web Application.******* \\}
We shall visualize what actors can do with the system. Each actor has a different role in the system developed. In this web system is divided into 2 actors, namely Student and Admin.

\textbf{Some of the actions that students can do on this system are:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a user account for access.
\item Enter their bio data while creating a user account.
\item Choose and select varieties of meal plans.
\item Give feedback and reviews on the quality of nutritional literature.
\item And Others.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Some of the actions that an Admin can do on this system are:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create or delete certain user accounts.
\item Update the number or meal plans available.
\item Increase or reduce the number of food groups available for the meal plans.
\item And Others.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Activity Diagram \\}
To start using this website, the user must first enter the website address. Users can be divided into two, namely customer and admin.  Students have to register themselves in order to choose a meal plan via the web application. For students already registered from the beginning of web development. To do it via the web, registered student can login. If the username or password entered is incorrect or not registered, you can re-login again. After logging in or not the student can see monthly diet and promo information on the web system homepage.

\paragraph{UML Class Diagram \\}
The UML Class Diagram on this website consists of seven classes as shown below.

Each class has different responsibilities and functions commonly referred to as attributes and operations. User class is used as login or login to the website, divided into admin and customer. Admin

and customer classes are the user’s biodata. Class Order to store data about an order. Payment class for storing and sending proof of payment. Product class is used to store biodata of available goods and stock availability. Shopping Cart class is used to store food data in the long run.

\subsubsection{System Implementation}
The system will be implemented using programming languages and system implementation tools. While developing the database, we shall use MySQL which is an open-source language developed by Oracle.  

In the process of developing the front-end part of the system, we use a variety of tools which include Html and CSS.  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) will be used to display content on the web browser whereas Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) will be used to make the web pages look attractive. 

In the process of backend development, we shall use PHP and this side majorly focuses on website architecture and everything related to interactions between the database information and the browser. 

\subsubsection{System Testing and Validation}
System testing will be done while referring to the requirement specifications of the system to see if the developed system satisfies the predefined functionality. The testing can be done through unit testing, integration testing and user acceptance testing.

\paragraph{Unit Testing \\}
This is where we shall tell individual functions that will be used in the system and this can involve testing a function that returns the number of meals stored in the system. To carry out unit testing, you can use a testing library for the programming language in use. This process is majorly done to ensure that the functions are acting like they were intended. 

\paragraph{Integration Testing \\}
After all functions are working fine, we shall move on to integration testing where all the functions are put together and then testing if they all work to get the needed output.

\paragraph{User Acceptance Testing \\}
This is the final type of testing and it is done by the end users to ensure that everything is working out fine and this will involve getting some students and allowing them to fully use the system for a specific number of days and then get feedback about the functionality of the system.
