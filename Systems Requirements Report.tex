\section{Problem statement}
\label{Problem statement}

\subsection{Problem statement}
Improper diet and nutrition are caused by inconsistent intake of healthy foods. Other causes include improper meal timings, under or overeating, not having enough healthy foods, and nutritional ignorance. Experts have revealed that only 10\% of children below the age of five years are eating recommended healthy foods and this includes frequent eating nutritious meals and eating on time. This has left the majority 90\% eating non-nutritious foods which has resulted in increasing numbers of childhood malnutrition and obesity (\citeauthor{tumwine2022only}, \citeyear{tumwine2022only}). We, therefore, intend to contain this problem by developing a diet and nutrition management system which will guide the targeted populace categories majorly students to maintain a healthy selection of well-balanced meals daily. We aim to develop a diet and nutrition management system that will provide students with timely suggestions on the food they should consume to remain healthy.

\subsection{Requirements gathering}
\subsubsection{Sampling Techniques}
We identified cluster random sampling as our method of choice. This is so because it can be used to study large, spread-out populations with similar characteristics where aiming to interview each subject would be costly, time-consuming, and perhaps impossible.

\subsubsection{Sampling Techniques}
Our target population is Makerere University Students.  We determined a sample size of 100 students per cluster(college) following the Multistage cluster sampling technique under Cluster Random Sampling.

\subsubsection{Data collection methods and instruments.}
The process of gathering and analyzing accurate data from various sources to find answers to research problems, trends, probabilities, etc., to evaluate possible outcomes is Known as Data Collection (\citeauthor{Simplelearn}, \citeyear{Simplelearn}). We applied both qualitative and quantitative research methods in the collection and analysis of data. Data was collected from different individuals ie. Students, nutritionists, and Restaurant managers. Online questionnaires (Google forms), and interview guides were used as tools. This data was later used for quantitative analysis.
Using descriptive statistics, on the other hand, an interview guide was carefully designed to capture views from respondents.
Using cluster random sampling, 300 students were randomly selected from the colleges (CHUSS, CEDAT, and COCIS).

\vspace{10pt}

\noindent With the use of the cluster sampling method, we randomly identified three colleges (CHUSS, COCIS, and CEDAT) as the clusters where we sampled 100 students. Data from those students was collected using Google's online forms structured as questionnaires (including both open-ended and close-ended questions) which provided more insight into its descriptive statistics e.g. percentages, frequencies, and mean to extract the most important information about the proposed system.
\vspace{10pt}

\noindent Upon the strong recommendation by our supervisor, we engaged in close consultation with a Nutritionist from the Well-Care clinic headed by Dr.Paul Kasenene through periodical visits.
We conducted an interview with the use of an interview guide. It included questions of types:  open-ended, opinion related, and behavioral which were intended to pick his professional thoughts on the causes of improper diet and nutrition along with the probable features we could implement to help meet the objectives of the proposed system.

\vspace{10pt}

\noindent Makerere students happen to dine in large numbers at the COCIS cafeteria and Africa Hallâ€™s dining area, this played a part in our decision to select the two restaurants where we interacted with the restaurant managers and used the interview approach with questions that included open-ended, opinion related and behavioral (related to students) to acquire general data that we could use to better understand the dietary patterns of students within the Makerere populace who buy their food.

\newpage
\noindent
\textbf{Qualitatively analyzed response from the Nutrionist.}

\noindent The responses from the nutrionist from well-care clinic were qualitatively analyzed and these were the key points.
\vspace{10pt}

\noindent The nutrionist suggested that several factors that contribute to poor eating habits among university students include ignorance, economic standing, and lack of discipline.

\vspace{10pt}

\noindent He also emphasized the importance of features that point towards mitigation, such as avoiding junk foods that directly invoke chronic illnesses and overly processed foods. Realistic options that promote sustainable work-life balance between healthy and junk foods were also suggested, with the inclusion  BMI readings and implementations that come along with the reading.

\vspace{10pt}

\noindent Regarding the target users of the proposed system, he recommended a focus on university students in the age bracket of 18-30, with a specific emphasis on males. When it comes to nutrients that make up a meal plan, he proposed including Vitamin B (fish, nuts), Magnesium (dark leaf vegetables), Vitamin K, Fibre, and Zinc (chia seeds). He stated proportions aren't necessary.

\vspace{10pt}

\noindent Regarding meal options, he advised not offering options with more than two starchy foods and adding in enough vegetables and fruits. He also suggested that a standard meal time of 8:00am-8:00pm and three meals in a day be implemented.

\vspace{10pt}

\noindent Overall, the nutrionist recommended making a flexible meal plan with short notes, many options, and graphics to cater for the needs of university students and promote healthy eating habits.

\vspace{40pt}

\noindent
\textbf{Qualitatively analyzed responses from Restuarant managers.}

\noindent
The responses from the two different restuarant managers were qualitatively analyzed and these were the key points noted.
\vspace{10pt}

\noindent
The Africa hall restaurant manager provided more detailed and diverse information, including insights on student preferences, cleanliness, ingredients, balanced diet, affordable prices, and favorite dishes. On the other hand, the COCIS restuarant manager
was more focused on customer complaints, limited space, and high prices of foodstuffs. Both respondents provided valuable perspectives on the restaurants and their operations, but the Africa hall retsuarant manager's response was more comprehensive.

\section{System User Requirements}
The following are the users of the system:\\
\textbf{System Administrator.} System administrators have a higher understanding of how the system will work and have more privileges compared to other users of the system.\\
\textbf{Registered users.} These include Makerere University students.

\subsection{Functional and Non-functional Requirements}
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements.}
These requirements describe what the system should be based on the actorâ€™s possible actions.\\
The functional requirements include;\\
\textbf{Registration Module.} The system should offer a registration module that allows all new users to register for an account.

\noindent
\textbf{Authentication Module.} Thesystem should offer an authentication module that allows registered users to log in through their created accounts.

\noindent
\textbf{Meal Planning Module.} The system should offer a meal planner module that creates and organizes meal schedules thereby allowing users to improve their diet by planning ahead for nutritious meals and tracking their calorie intake. From our findings, we observed that the majority of the respondents didnâ€™t have a consistent meal plan. This justifies the need for implementing this feature in the system.

\noindent
\textbf{Timely Reminder Module.} The system should also provide timely reminder module which notifies the users when a particular meal is meant to be consumed according to the meal plan. Following our findings, the majority of the respondents lacked a clear time frame for ingesting particular meals.

\noindent
\textbf{Food suggestions Module.} The system should also offer food suggestions module which provides users with a variety of foods locally available to the populace. The findings indicated that most students cook food in addition to buying it in different circumstances. Implementing this module avails many options for the users to choose from.

\noindent
\textbf{Nutrition Analysis Module.} The system should nutrition analysis module analyzes food inputs and returns a response consisting of an array of different nutrients along with their food values.

\noindent
\textbf{BMI calculator Module.} The system should also provide a BMI calculator module  that informs the user of their height-to-weight ratio. Implementing this module helps users in the bid to track their calorie intake.

\subsubsection{Non-functional Requirements.}
These requirements specify the criteria that can be used to judge the operation of the system rather than specific behavior. They define system properties and the constraints of the system. The system must show software quality attributes such as accuracy, performance, cost security, and usability. The non-functional requirements include:
\begin{itemize}
\item The system should be easy to maintain and adaptable to the users.

\item The system should provide forms of data capture during registration and login.

\item The system must provide login security at the application level.

\item The system should process user requests and return responses in time.

\item The system should be operational 24/7.

\item The system should be responsive i.e it should provide immediate feedback to users.

\end{itemize}
